# Cuisine Restaurant Website

Welcome to the **Cuisine Restaurant Website**! This is a user-friendly, responsive front-end web project for a restaurant that allows users to browse the menu, make reservations, and get information about the restaurant. It's designed to be visually appealing and functional across all devices.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used**: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This project was built to provide a digital space for a fictional cuisine restaurant. It features a clean and minimalistic design with a focus on usability and responsiveness. The website includes sections for:

- **Dynamic Menu**: Interactive menu with easily updateable items.
- **Restaurant Info**: A section displaying the restaurant's address, contact details, and brief description.
- **Event Updates**: Stay informed about upcoming events and promotions.

I used **HTML** for the structure of the pages, **CSS** for styling and layout, and **JavaScript** to handle dynamic content like the reservation system.

## Optimizations
- **Responsive Design**: Made the website fully responsive and looks great on devices of all sizes.
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed images to improve load times and reduce page size, enhancing performance across mobile and desktop devices.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading for images to improve the website's speed, especially on mobile.

## Lessons Learned:
- **Responsive Design**: I had to think about the user experience on different devices, especially mobile, which was a new challenge for me.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: This was my first time integrating a simple JavaScript form (for the reservation system), and I learned how to capture user input and provide a smooth experience without requiring server-side processing.
- **CSS Flexbox & Grid**: I used Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout management, which helped me align elements in a more fluid way and better understand modern CSS techniques.

Building this website helped me realize how much I enjoy front-end development and working on projects that have a real-world application, like a restaurant website.
